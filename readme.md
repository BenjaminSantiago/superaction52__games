# Super Action 52 --> GAMES

This is the repo of the actual SNES game source code and ROMS for Super Action 52. 

For this project I will create one (small, fun) game per week for a year. 

It is (obviously?) based on the infamous multicart Action 52 on NES and Sega Genesis. 

- WEEK #01 --> Jupiter Scope
- WEEK #02 --> TAPATAN
